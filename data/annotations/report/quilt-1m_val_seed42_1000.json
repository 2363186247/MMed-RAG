It's completely pushed the elastosis out of the way and laid down new collagen. So, angiofibroma or fibrous papule. Benign and beautiful. All right. What's this one? Fibrous hamartoma.",

I do get worried if I see atypical mitoses like tripolar mitotic figures or pleomorphism or infiltrated invasive growth, those things are all concerning to me. Okay, so then what is, I will let you guys decide. We've got obvious sebacites, blue basaloid cells, and the basaloid cells make up the majority of the tumor, more than half of the tumor, whereas the sebacites, the mature sebacites, make up less than half the tumor. So what is the diagnosis? You're welcome to type it into the chat if you want. You'll get an invisible bonus point from me if you get it right. Or you can just quiz yourself and know in your heart the joy of making the diagnosis. Okay, I see someone, there we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Yeah, this is a sebaceoma. Sebaceoma is basically, in my view, on a spectrum of sebaceous adenoma. So don't lose sleep over deciding whether to call something sebaceous adenoma or sebaceoma. It doesn't matter. They're both benign sebaceous neoplasms. And it's, in my opinion, purely an arbitrary distinction that we've made by saying if it's more than 50% basaloid blue cells, then it's sebaceoma. And if it's more than 50% are the mature sebacites, then we call it sebaceous adenoma. Okay, cool. Sometimes in DermPath, we like to split a little bit too much. And I think splitting is fun for conferences and for teaching, but in the real world, we have to think about what really matters for patient care. And the point is that both of these tumors are benign, but have the potential to be associated with Muratori syndrome. And Van Hung makes a very good point that this is a great time to get the diagnosis wrong because A, the chat screen is hidden from the video. So maybe your colleagues will see that you got it wrong, but no one on the internet will, okay? And the other thing that is important about this is that if you get it wrong, no one dies and you don't get sued. And I like to tell my residents that, and it's kind of that I'm joking, but also it's totally true. When you're in training or when you're in a conference, it's a great time to look at a case and say, I think this is the diagnosis and to be totally wrong because that's how you learn how you set your internal diagnostic thresholds. When you look at something and you realize, man, the last three times I saw this tumor, I thought it was benign, but it's actually malignant. Then you learn that's a tumor I need to spend more time thinking about and studying and looking at. And I think that's a great way to learn. And I actually do that even to this day, even though I'm not a trainee anymore on the internet when people show cases and I say, oh, I think this unknown case is gonna be this. And then they're like, wrong, it metastasized. It was actually melanoma. I'm like, well, that was a hard case. And it's good to see what things I look at and get right and which things I get wrong. This is the way that we adjust our gut feeling. And if you haven't read it, there's a really great book by Malcolm Gladwell called Blink. And I think it should be required reading for all pathologists, probably for all doctors, because it's all about how we look at things and make subconscious decisions before we are cognitively aware of it, that there are little, the underpinnings of the way our brain works are picking up little details. And so all of that technical stuff there, I think amounts to what we have that we call a gut feeling. And so I can realize that sometimes my gut feeling is, ooh, I'm worried about this, but it ends up being benign. And if the last 10 times I was worried about something, this certain thing, I realized, oh, that always looks scary, but it ends up not being scary. And so that's how I adjust my gut feeling. So in any case, there's a little bit of philosophy lesson for you today, but I think it's a really great way to learn. I still remember cases from residency where I was wrong, where a junior resident told me they thought it was something. And I was like, oh no, no, I'm the senior resident. I'm going into DermPath. And I was totally wrong, totally wrong. And I still can't get over those things, but I remember. And hopefully that will help me help my patients with it. Okay, thank you for letting me preach.

And then they're like, wrong, it metastasized. It was actually melanoma. I'm like, well, that was a hard case. And it's good to see what things I look at and get right and which things I get wrong. This is the way that we adjust our gut feeling. And if you haven't read it, there's a really great book by Malcolm Gladwell called Blink. And I think it should be required reading for all pathologists, probably for all doctors, because it's all about how we look at things and make subconscious decisions before we are cognitively aware of it, that there are little, the underpinnings of the way our brain works are picking up little details. And so all of that technical stuff there, I think amounts to what we have that we call a gut feeling. And so I can realize that sometimes my gut feeling is, ooh, I'm worried about this, but it ends up being benign. And if the last 10 times I was worried about something, this certain thing, I realized, oh, that always looks scary, but it ends up not being scary. And so that's how I adjust my gut feeling. So in any case, there's a little bit of philosophy lesson for you today, but I think it's a really great way to learn. I still remember cases from residency where I was wrong, where a junior resident told me they thought it was something. And I was like, oh no, no, I'm the senior resident. I'm going into dermatopathology. And I was totally wrong, totally wrong. And I still can't get over those things, but I remember. And hopefully that will help me help my patients with it. Okay, thank you for letting me preach. I appreciate it. Now, this is a sebaceoma. All right, so let's move forward. And by",

But if I see a lot of cytoplasm these are most likely histiocytes, macrophages. So if I see a lot of cytoplasm then mostly they are histiocytes or macrophages. So this is mostly a histiocytic infiltrate. So histiocytic infiltrate in the skin is also known as granulomatous dermatitis. So if this is a granulomatous dermatitis, what is the pattern here? It is a palisaded granuloma. So in the skin if you think of granulomatous dermatitis, is it a palisaded granuloma, is it a sarcoidal granuloma or is it like a foreign body type of granuloma? Those are the three things. Or is it something that is associated with a lot of neutrophils? So if it is associated with a lot of neutrophils it is known as suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. And then you are going to think of some sort of infectious process. If I see a granulomatous inflammation with a lot of neutrophils that mix then I am always going to think of maybe I am dealing with fungal infection, maybe I am dealing with an atypical mycobacteria and I go in that direction. If I see a palisaded granuloma, what do I mean by a palisade? The word palisade comes from the word fence. So it is forming like a fence basically. So this is forming like a fence around something basically. So if you think of a palisaded granuloma you are either going to deal with granuloma annulari, rheumatoid nodule, or necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Those are the three main things to think of. There are other things but the three common ones that you need to think of are GA, NLD, rheumatoid nodule, NLD which is necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Those are the four differential diagnoses for any palisaded granuloma. There are other zebras but for you if you can remember these four things that is more than enough actually. So now you have a list of differential diagnoses that is narrowed down quite a bit. So what are the features that you want to see to make a diagnosis of granuloma annulari? You want to see mucin but if you don't on the exam they might not give you the mucin stain. So you see the EOS but what is the character you are going to see this palisaded granuloma around? It is mostly a necrobiotic collagen basically. In rheumatoid nodule it is fibrinoid material within the palisade. So if I see a very pink material within the palisade that is the fibrinoid degeneration then I am going to think of rheumatoid nodule. In GA it is mostly around necrobiotic collagen so what I see is altered collagen within the palisade. So if I see a palisade with altered collagen then I am going to think of granuloma annulari. In NLD what is the pattern? You are going to see the layers actually. So if I see a palisaded granuloma in layers then I am going to think of NLD. The last one is necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. The word itself is telling you what to look for. I am going to look for a lot of necrosis basically. So if I see a lot of necrosis or necrobiosis then I am going to think of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. If I see very pink material within the palisade then I am going to think of rheumatoid nodule. If I see very altered collagen within the palisade then I am going to think of granuloma annulari and if I see the layers then I am going to think of NLD. So these are the four differential diagnoses for any palisaded granule. So what one is this basically? GA actually because you see the palisaded granuloma around altered collagen bundles. Yes if I do a mucin stain I am going to see increased mucin within the palisade. So if I see increased mucin within the palisade that helps me that this is a diagnosis of granuloma annulari. But remember this macrophages when you start seeing macrophages first thing is I am dealing with the granulomatous rheumatoid. Next is what is the kind of granulomas? Is it sarcoidal, is it palisaded, is it suppurative or is it foreign body type? This is a palisaded granuloma. Now palisaded granuloma so my list of differential diagnoses is four. Then you just go through your list of differential diagnoses and you make your diagnosis. So perivascular lymphocytes with interstitial macrophages, palisaded granulomas arranged collagen necrobiosis and admixed eosinophils.",
        "corrected_text": " or a lot of cytoplasm? It is a lot of cytoplasm. Lymphocytes tend to have very little cytoplasm. But if I see a lot of cytoplasm these are most likely histiocytes, macrophages. So if I see a lot of cytoplasm then mostly they are histiocytes or macrophages. So this is mostly a histiocytic infiltrate. So histiocytic infiltrate in the skin is also known as granulomatous dermatitis. So if this is a granulomatous dermatitis, what is the pattern here? It is a palisading granuloma. So in the skin if you think of granulomatous dermatitis, is it a palisading granuloma, is it a sarcoidal granuloma or is it like a foreign body type of granuloma? Those are the three things. Or is it something that is associated with a lot of neutrophils? So if it is associated with a lot of neutrophils it is known as suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. And then you are going to think of some sort of infectious process. If I see a granulomatous inflammation with a lot of neutrophils that mix then I am always going to think of maybe I am dealing with fungal infection, maybe I am dealing with an atypical mycobacteria and I go in that direction. If I see a palisading granuloma, what do I mean by a palisade? The word palisade comes from the word fence. So it is forming like a fence basically. So this is forming like a fence around something basically. So if you think of a palisading granuloma you are either going to deal with granuloma annulare, rheumatoid nodule, or necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Those are the three main things to think of. There are other things but the three common ones that you need to think of are GA, NLD, rheumatoid nodule, NLD which is necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Those are the four differential diagnoses for any palisading granuloma. There are other zebras but for you if you can remember these four things that is more than enough actually. So now you have a list of differential diagnoses that is narrowed down quite a bit. So what are the features that you want to see to make a diagnosis of granuloma annulare? You want to see mucin but if you don't on the exam they might not give you the mucin stain. So you see the EOS but what is the character you are going to see this palisading granuloma around? It is mostly a necrobiotic collagen basically. In rheumatoid nodule it is fibrinoid material within the palisade. So if I see a very pink material within the palisade that is the fibrinoid degeneration then I am going to think of rheumatoid nodule. In GA it is mostly around necrobiotic collagen so what I see is altered collagen within the palisade. So if I see a palisade with altered collagen then I am going to think of granuloma annulare. In NLD what is the pattern? You are going to see the layers actually. So if I see a palisading granuloma in layers then I am going to think of NLD. The last one is necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. The word itself is telling you what to look for. I am going to look for a lot of necrosis basically. So if I see a lot of necrosis or necrobiosis then I am going to think of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. If I see very pink material within the palisade then I am going to think of rheumatoid nodule. If I see very altered collagen within the palisade then I am going to think of granuloma annulare and if I see the layers then I am going to think of NLD.

Intercalated ducts, always smaller than striated ducts, yes. So they start out, as I said, as simple squamous, and then become very low cuboidal. And then the striated ducts are always the bigger ones, like this. You can see they're almost a columnar in appearance. But their nuclei often give a little bit of evidence of a cuboidal shape, even though some of them are a little bit elongated. Now, you might be able to make out some of these little basal striations. What these are are basolateral membranous infoldings. What the heck does that mean? Well, if we think about a cuboidal cell. So Jamie, sorry, was that a question here? Hey, Jamie, was that intercalated to striated to interlobular lumen surface? Yes. So from interlobular, you go to lobar ducts, draining each lobe. And then that has a main duct, which empties into the surface of the oral cavity. So that's exactly right, MJ Grin. Thanks for asking the question.

But if you want to increase the surface area of the membrane at the base of the cell, you've really got nowhere to go because you're sitting on a basement membrane. So rather than having projected membrane so rather than having projections outwards, what the cell does is it has projections inwards.

So they're actually a means of having an increase in surface area of the cell membrane at the basal surface so that you can have more ion channels and things like that.

        "noisy_text": " Now we'll talk about the integumentary system. Integument refers to skin, and there are two major parts to skin. You have the epidermis, which is composed of a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, and the other part of the skin is not an epithelium, but rather it is dense irregular connective tissue, which is the dermis. As we're going to see, there are different layers to each of these structures. The epidermis in particular is quite a bit different on different regions of skin, depending on whether you're looking at thin skin or thick skin. On this particular section, we have a section of thick skin, which is found on the palms of your hand or the soles of your feet. It has a much thicker epidermal layer than thin skin has, which is how it gets its name. In thick skin, there are five distinct layers of the epidermis that you can visualize. We're going to talk about each of these layers, starting with the basal most layer, which is immediately adjacent to the underlying dermis here. The basal most layer, which tends to be more basophilic than the superficial layers, is called the stratum basal. You can remember that because it's the basal most layer. These cells are typically cuboidal to columnar in shape. They have dense basophilic staining nuclei. These cells have a high rate of mitotic activity, so they proliferate at high rates to regenerate the upper epithelial layers, which are constantly sloughing off. Here we have stratum basal, can be several layers thick. Similar to the stratum basal, you have the next layer, which is called the stratum spinosum. The stratum spinosum gets its name because in some sections that are treated with standard histological stains, such as H and E, you can see intermediate fibers, the tonofilaments that attach to the desmosomes. Much of the cells tend to shrink back, but it causes these intermediate filaments of the desmosomes to really stick out, and it gives them a kind of spiny appearance. That's why it gets its name, stratum spinosum. You may or may not be able to see the spines on your slide. In order to see them, you'll need to look at high magnification. The stratum spinosum is a relatively thick layer, thicker than the stratum basal typically. Superficial to the stratum spinosum, you have this densely staining basophilic layer, which is called the stratum granulosum, so called because of the presence of numerous granules in the cytoplasm of these cells. This is only a couple cell layers thick, and this really marks the last layer of living cells in stratified keratinized epithelium. All the cells above this layer are essentially dead. Partly that's due to the fact that these cells are producing glycoproteins that help to form a protective hydrophobic barrier above them, and so that also prevents nutrients from being able to diffuse and sustain these cells, which is partly why they die. Superficial to the stratum granulosum, you have this translucent appearing fairly clear layer, which is called the stratum lucidum. That refers to it being lucid or clear, which is what that means, so if you're thinking lucidly, you're thinking clearly, so that should help you remember the name of this layer. Stratum lucidum is only visible in thick skin, so if you see this very distinctive layer, that tells you you're looking at thick skin. And finally, superficial to the stratum lucidum, you have the thick stratum corneum layer, which like the cells in the stratum lucidum are dead, but it does not have that translucent appearance. You cannot see nuclei in the cells of these layers. These cells are basically dead and impregnated with large amounts of keratin, so they're essentially dead cellular husks. So here's a higher magnification view, and we can go through all these layers again. Here at",
        "corrected_text": " Now we'talk about the integumentary system. Integument refers to skin, and there are two major parts to skin. You have the epidermis, which is composed of a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, and the other part of the skin is not an epithelium, but rather it is dense irregular connective tissue, which is the dermis. As we're going to see, there are different layers to each of these structures. The epidermis in particular is quite a bit different on different regions of skin, depending on whether you're looking at thin skin or thick skin. On this particular section, we have a section of thick skin, which is found on the palms of your hand or the soles of your feet. It has a much thicker epidermal layer than thin skin has, which is how it gets its name. In thick skin, there are five distinct layers of the epidermis that you can visualize. We're going to talk about each of these layers, starting with the basal most layer, which is immediately adjacent to the underlying dermis here. The basal most layer, which tends to be more basophilic than the superficial layers, is called the basal cell layer. You can remember that because it's the basal most layer. These cells are typically cuboidal to columnar in shape. They have dense basophilic staining nuclei. These cells have a high rate of mitotic activity, so they proliferate at high rates to regenerate the upper epithelial layers, which are constantly sloughing off. Here we have basal cell layer, can be several layers thick. Similar to the basal cell layer, you have the next layer, which is called the stratum spinosum. The stratum spinosum gets its name because in some sections that are treated with standard histological stains, such as H and E, you can see intermediate fibers, the tonofilaments that attach to the desmosomes. Much of the cells tend to shrink back, but it causes these intermediate filaments of the desmosomes to really stick out, and it gives them a kind of spiny appearance. That's why it gets its name, stratum spinosum. You may or may not be able to see the spines on your slide. In order to see them, you'll need to look at high magnification. The stratum spinosum is a relatively thick layer, thicker than the basal cell layer typically. Superficial to the stratum spinosum, you have this densely staining basophilic layer, which is called the stratum granulosum, so called because of the presence of numerous granules in the cytoplasm of these cells. This is only a couple cell layers thick, and this really marks the last layer of living cells in stratified keratinized epithelium. All the cells above this layer are essentially dead. Partly that's due to the fact that these cells are producing glycoproteins that help to form a protective hydrophobic barrier above them, and so that also prevents nutrients from being able to diffuse and sustain these cells, which is partly why they die. Superficial to the stratum granulosum, you have this translucent appearing fairly clear layer, which is called the stratum lucidum. That refers to it being lucid or clear, which is what that means, so if you're thinking clearly, you're thinking clearly, so that should help you remember the name of this layer. Stratum lucidum is only visible in thick skin, so if you see this very distinctive layer, that tells you you're looking at thick skin. And finally, superficial to the stratum lucidum, you have the thick stratum corneum layer, which like the cells in the stratum lucidum are dead, but it does not have that translucent appearance. You cannot see nuclei in the cells of these layers. These cells are basically dead and impregnated with large amounts of keratin, so they're essentially dead cellular husks.

They are small arteries because one rule of thumb could be because they're not isolated and they're within the wall of an organ. An excellent place to look because of its very vascular nature is in the wall or the adventitia of the gallbladder. The small arteries will show a very prominent media.

So this is an artery always characterized as is the aorta or the elastic, the muscular arteries, all through the arterial system by the dominance of smooth muscle in the media wall.

But a prominent feature is always the smooth muscle in the media wall that sort of forms a donut, a very prominent ring, all the way through the system, all down to the smallest arterial. And this should make perfect sense. This is how arterial pressure is maintained by the contraction and the pressure exerted on the lumen by this media in the smooth muscle wall. Nonetheless, this is a typical small artery. It perhaps has eight or 10 smooth muscle wraps. Most small arteries, they'll extend maybe from 15 or 20 smooth muscle wraps down to about three.

The last thing you should look at is the cytologic features. Do not go to high power. You're going to freak out. You can get big, ugly scattered cells and dermatofibroma is totally benign. You can have mitoses in dermatofibroma, totally benign. You can have some fat entrapment at the bottom even totally okay. Look, see there's some fat involvement there. So I get these sent to me when they entrap the fat, but that's okay. You do have to think about DFSP. Okay. They're metafibrosarcoma pituberans, but most of the time you can tell DF and DFSP apart on H and E, not with immunostains. I do occasionally do immunostains to tell it apart, particularly if I have a partial biopsy and I can't see the bottom or the sides. So I lose a lot of those clues that I have about the interface with the collagen and the fat, okay. But fat entrapment is sometimes seen in DFs, particularly big cellular ones like this. This is a cellular DF, giant cells, foamy histiocytes, tooth on cells, hemosiderin, blood, all favor dermatofibroma",

So I wasn't gonna go into metastases here, but if you were debating between a metastasis versus say microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and you could only do one immunostain to help sort those out, what would you do to sort out a skin adnexal tumor from a metastatic adenocarcinoma? Any takers? You can type it into the chat box. This is one of these little things that I actually find very helpful in real practice and I use it a lot, no one's taking it, EMA, good idea. So keratin's gonna stay in this, but it's also gonna stay in metastatic carcinoma. Mucicarminal stain, anything that makes mucin, which this tumor is not making epithelial mucins, this is not making epithelial mucins, so that could help if you have an adenocarcinoma that's making epithelial mucin. CK7 can stain a lot of different sweat gland tumors and so can EMA. EMA can also stain squamous cell carcinomas for that matter. CEA will highlight these ducts, that's true, but it will highlight a lot of different adenocarcinoma ducts. So the answer in my book is P63 or P40, which both work equivalently in my experience, that those are the vast majority of skin adnexal tumors, both benign and malignant, with a few exceptions like mucinous carcinoma and some apocrine carcinomas in the skin will be P63 negative, but most other adnexal tumors, benign ones and malignant ones, as well as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and seborrheic keratosis, all of the epidermal derived tumors, all of those tumors are gonna have strong diffuse P63 and P40 expression in their nuclei, whereas adenocarcinomas from visceral organs are usually negative for those markers. One exception is that a small subset of lung adenocarcinomas can express P63, which is why P40 basically became popular to help lung pathologists sort out adeno versus squame. So I found that the published data talks mostly about P63 as supportive of skin adnexal tumors versus metastatic adeno, but I found that P40 works similarly.

I think that's where we go wrong in interstitial lung disease is that we know that these antibodies are non-specific and they don't necessarily mean that the process in the interstitium is related to the antibody. But when it comes to a fibrotic interstitial pneumonia, we don't have any confidence in our, you know, so the moment it comes to interstitial fibrosis or chronic inflammation, everything becomes hypersensitivity if you have some kind of a clinical indication. So I think we are not skeptical enough in that setting as we are here appropriately. In this case, we are skeptical and",

I mean, it's transitional epithelium-like bladder, but is this coming from a teratoma, do you think? Is this a developmental remnant? Is it a benign migrating tissue like endometriosis and endosalpingiosis, or do we have any ideas on that? It's a remnant. I believe it was a remnant. Yeah, it probably is, something like that. Just like we have the Walthard res and the serosa of the fallopian tube from time to time, these probably are derived similarly. And then you get some degree of growth and the stromal response related to that that produces this tumor-like lesion. OK, very good. So I think we're back to Eleanor. OK, so here's number eight. So low pair impression, looks like we've got kind of serial",

So let's take a look at and see what the choices are, what the question is. 35-year-old woman comes in for evaluation of a concerning nodule on her face. Best diagnosis is, okay, clear cell syringoma. Can you get clear cells in that? Yes, you can. Can those cells sometimes be nested? Yes, they sometimes can be. But what else do you see in syringoma? You always have ductal differentiation. Do we have any of that here? No. And do we have any other areas where there are some obvious nests of cells here, like over here, which are obviously nests of the nevus? We do",
        "corrected_text": " we start thinking, well, maybe they're balloon cells of a balloon cell nevus. Could it be melanoma? Well, probably not given it's got those other features of that, but obviously whenever we see Pagetoid spread of cells or cells that have been a cytoplasm and a melanocytic lesion, we always kind of tap the brakes and ask ourselves any chance it could be melanoma and make sure that they're mitoses or atypical cells or anything else in there that's kind of breaking the rules. But here we really don't see anything like that. So we would favor the diagnosis possibly of a balloon cell nevus in here.

And these classically are made of epithelioid histiocytes or histiocytoid cells with a collagenous background and this dome-shaped papule, usually with a cholera around it and with dilated vessels. Okay, so when I was in fellowship, these were at the time thought to be a variant of dermatofibroma. And that never sat terribly well with me because for one thing, they don't really look like a dermatofibroma. They're pushed right against the surface. They have a collar. They don't have collagen trapping usually. They don't really have any of the features that we typically see in conventional fibrous histiocytoma slash dermatofibroma. Also about half the time they can express EMA, which is something you don't see in traditional conventional dermatofibroma. So I never really liked that explanation.

When it gets into the reticular dermis, well, then we refer to it as both a dermal sclerotic pattern with the LSNA pattern, rather than just calling it LSNA alone. And that's maybe of some importance. I mean, if you're gonna treat the dermal, deeper dermal component of that, you're not gonna be able to treat that with a topical steroid or something like that. This disease may be a minimal to some of those things, at least to some degree, but once you get down into the dermis, it's harder to treat with the topical. And then one other thing about this, notice the cornified layer. So gosh,",

So this is what we call one of the so-called overlap disorders, overlap between lupus and scleroderma. So this is basically, this patient had discoid LE, had the sclerotic collagen in there, which is unusual for discoid lupus like this. Didn't have much inflammation anymore. So sometimes you'll get the lymphocytic infiltrates and you'll get the thinning in the epidermis, the mucin, all that kind of stuff. Some cases you get this. So just understand that there's several different overlaps. What are some other, what's another overlap between scleroderma or sclerotic processes in another connective tissue disease that we see sometimes? Just like other things off the square patch differential or like other sclerodermic, like scleromyxedema, scleroderma or sclerodema diabeticorum, but those are more depositional. Yeah, those really are. Yeah, exactly. Those really don't fit. Like the sclerodermoid kind. That could possibly fit in here. I would buy that.

Sclerodermatomyositis is the other one. Patient with dermatomyositis, got no dermatomyositis, 100%, they got elevated muscle enzyme levels, they're weak, they might even have an underlying cancer and they got reticulated poikiloderma. And sometimes your biopsy, your skin feels kind of firm and sclerotic. You biopsy, it looks like this also. This could be sclerodermatomyositis. In this case, the patient, they had lupus for sure and had sclerotic changes, but sometimes you'll see dermatomyositis, they can get sclerotic changes. So basically just understand that the way these connective tissue diseases, they don't always look like the classic obvious features in the textbook. Sometimes they can have secondary changes, like this is lupus with a lot of scleroderma-like changes. So that's just kind of the teaching point of this case. Thank you.

So when I think it's an odd kind of scenario, that's when I do nut. Otherwise, again, we don't have the stain in now, so we have to send it out. So I have to carefully think about doing it. Yeah. Is this the Q67 here? Yes, I showed the Q67 that it's crazy, crazy positive. What a shock, right? I mean, I feel about the Q67 in an overtly high grade carcinoma, what is the point? It tells you what you already know from the HME. Would you agree, Ren\u00e9? Yes, in this case, it's because it's part of the panel. It helps when it's crushed. It's the big use of Q67 is when it's crushed, and you can see the morphology well, it helps. Yeah, I do it only in selective scenarios, like when you have a small sample and you have the cells at the edge of the biopsy, and they're all crushed. That's when I use Q67, when I really want to differentiate from a carcinoid tumor. Otherwise, when you have acres and acres of land where you can see it's all high grade, I shy away or save money not doing Q67. It's a problem to do it, because it has happened to me, this neuroblast with a low KI67, so what? I said small cell anyway, so for what? Because sometimes it does, very, very few times, but sometimes it doesn't work or something happens, and you find that there is no KI67 in this case. So what do you do? You call it a small cell again, so for what? What's the problem with that? I think people who use the KI67 tend to gloss over the technical problems with the KI67, or exceptions, because yes, it is true that small cells will be positive, blazingly positive in most cases, and carcinoids will not, but things in between will cause problems where there were no problems on the HNE. So you might actually create problems where there were none, but I would like to hear the other side of this. So Matt, why do you do the KI67, and do you ever encounter problems with KI67 interpretation? Yeah, so I don't do it in all cases, but there's often a clinical request for it. I think some of the clinicians like to know what it is. I think it gives them a sense of how fast it's growing, or I'm not sure how they actually change it, because all small cells really get treated the same. But that's the one aspect of it, and I agree that the best use is in the small crushed biopsies where you don't want to overcall a carcinoid, because that can happen, right? If you can't, I think you have to be really careful in neuroendocrine things if you don't see clear mitotic activity or necrosis. If you don't see lots of that in a small biopsy, I think a KI67 is mandatory before calling anything high-grade, because it's definitely a pitfall that you think you wouldn't call a carcinoid small cell, but in limited tissue or in crushed, it is possible.

You might have some eosinophils or the eosinophils are not always present, but if they are present, it's good. So basically the reaction pattern that you're seeing here is an exhumative process or a spongiotic dermatitis. And because of the acute reaction, it is an acute spongiotic process. And the prototypical lesion for an acute spongiotic process is allergic contact dermatitis. And allergic contact dermatitis when the patient has been exposed to something, then they're going to develop these spongiotic changes in the epidermis with vesiculation. But you have to always remember, many times in the report, they're just going to get a spongiotic dermatitis as a report basically. And it can be related to a lot of different things. So there's a paper about spongiosis and the way it goes is spongiosis can be caused by 800 things actually. So this pattern can be seen in deshydrotic eczema. This pattern can be seen in nominal eczema. So a clinical pathological correlation is very important when you're talking about any exhumative process actually.

So based on that, what is the changes that you're going to see in the skin are going to be some changes that will tell you that something is irritating the epidermis. On the top, you're going to see some dyskeratotic cells and also some neutrophils. So if you see those, then you think of irritant contact dermatitis actually. So you have to do a clinical pathological correlation to come to a definitive diagnosis in an exhumative process. Otherwise, most of the times the report that you're going to get is spongiotic dermatitis. It could be acute, it could be subacute, or it could be chronic. When it becomes chronic, the patient has been scratching a lot. And so the same, because of the scratching, the epidermis is going to react in a certain way. So it is going to become acanthotic.

Of course, bridging is not a phenomena that you tend to see in a dermal component. It is a feature that's very, very specific for the junctional component. So this is one thing to highlight here. But the other things as well is the pigmentations, this wide bridging, as I told you, between three or four nests together, trying to fuse together. So all of these are features that you can characterize as a spandrel cell nevus of weed. Now, if you are under the stress of the exam and you don't know, oh, I am panicking, I don't know, then just call it a spandrel cell nevus because under the group of benign spandrel cell nevi will come the spits and will come the spandrel cell nevus of weed. The problem, obviously, that if you cannot name it as spandrel cell nevus of weed, then you cannot give us the brownie point, the clinical information. You see, so what I tend to then, if I wanted to score more for a case like this, maybe the maximum score that the examiner will allow you for a case like this is three. And this is an important point, again, back to when I first talk about how we score. I told you there will be cases where you cannot score more than 2.5 or 3, even if you wrote five pages worth of answers. What is important that as we practice and as you do mock to recognize which cases are these. So, for example, I told you granular cell tumor will be probably one of these cases where you cannot write anymore. And therefore, no matter how you try to write anything about it, you probably will still score 2.5. The same things apply, for example, if you're getting squamous cell carcinoma in the exam. You know, these are cases, although you are very happy that you got a squamous cell carcinoma and you knew the diagnosis because it's an easy case, but the downside of this, that you cannot score more than 2.5, which basically put a lot of pressure on the other cases. Now, because as I told you, if you got all your answers correct, except one, and you're scoring 2.5 in all of them, except for that one, then you fail because you don't get the 50 pass mark for the short surgical, for example. It's an odd scenario in all situations, but just be aware. So, probably in this case, if you are to score, you might then score, you might say, then in the differential, so you put your diagnosis as a spindle cell nevus of reed, and then you put the differential diagnosis, I have considered melanoma in situ. However, this is unlikely because I did not see a pagetoid spread into higher layer of the epidermis. I did not see abnormal mitotic activity or frequent mitotic activity, and there is no, for example, invasive dermal component. You can put this in between brackets. What I am trying to tell you that you need to spill out this information on the paper, the examiner will not know how did you exclude the fact that, first, the examiner wants to know did you consider melanoma, and if you would have considered melanoma, then how did you get rid of it? So, you need to tell the examiner, I excluded this because, so you can write that in the differential diagnosis section, and when we come to the additional work, as I said, additional work might include levels, immuno-stochemistry might include special stains, you see, so all of those things you might include it, but here in this case, you don't really need immuno, you don't need anything, and therefore, you can then write non-contributory, but again, you need to tell me that you thought about additional work, and this is the way that I would write it in the exam, I will say additional work and non-contributory, and then for further work, for additional information, then section to be able to score points, so I told you this is a 34-year-old, so you can then link this, so you'd say this lesion usually present in a young adult, and the age which has been given does match this, so now you have done your clinical pathological correlation here, which is great, okay? Number two is you can also say if you think that this lesion is completely excised, which we think it is here, then you",

        "noisy_text": " Now we'll talk about the integumentary system. Integument refers to skin, and there are two major parts to skin. You have the epidermis, which is composed of a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, and the other part of the skin is not an epithelium, but rather it is dense irregular connective tissue, which is the dermis. As we're going to see, there are different layers to each of these structures. The epidermis in particular is quite a bit different on different regions of skin, depending on whether you're looking at thin skin or thick skin. On this particular section, we have a section of thick skin, which is found on the palms of your hand or the soles of your feet. It has a much thicker epidermal layer than thin skin has, which is how it gets its name. In thick skin, there are five distinct layers of the epidermis that you can visualize. We're going to talk about each of these layers, starting with the basal most layer, which is immediately adjacent to the underlying dermis here. The basal most layer, which tends to be more basophilic than the superficial layers, is called the stratum basal. You can remember that because it's the basal most layer. These cells are typically cuboidal to columnar in shape. They have dense basophilic staining nuclei. These cells have a high rate of mitotic activity, so they proliferate at high rates to regenerate the upper epithelial layers, which are constantly sloughing off. Here we have stratum basal, can be several layers thick. Similar to the stratum basal, you have the next layer, which is called the stratum spinosum. The stratum spinosum gets its name because in some sections that are treated with standard histological stains, such as H and E, you can see intermediate fibers, the tonofilaments that attach to the desmosomes. Much of the cells tend to shrink back, but it causes these intermediate filaments of the desmosomes to really stick out, and it gives them a kind of spiny appearance. That's why it gets its name, stratum spinosum. You may or may not be able to see the spines on your slide. In order to see them, you'll need to look at high magnification. The stratum spinosum is a relatively thick layer, thicker than the stratum basal typically. Superficial to the stratum spinosum, you have this densely staining basophilic layer, which is called the stratum granulosum, so called because of the presence of numerous granules in the cytoplasm of these cells. This is only a couple cell layers thick, and this really marks the last layer of living cells in stratified keratinized epithelium. All the cells above this layer are essentially dead. Partly that's due to the fact that these cells are producing glycoproteins that help to form a protective hydrophobic barrier above them, and so that also prevents nutrients from being able to diffuse and sustain these cells, which is partly why they die. Superficial to the stratum granulosum, you have this translucent appearing fairly clear layer, which is called the stratum lucidum. That refers to it being lucid or clear, which is what that means, so if you're thinking lucidly, you're thinking clearly, so that should help you remember the name of this layer. Stratum lucidum is only visible in thick skin, so if you see this very distinctive layer, that tells you you're looking at thick skin. And finally, superficial to the stratum lucidum, you have the thick stratum corneum layer, which like the cells in the stratum lucidum are dead, but it does not have that translucent appearance. You cannot see nuclei in the cells of these layers. These cells are basically dead and impregnated with large amounts of keratin, so they're essentially dead cellular husks. So here's a higher magnification view, and we can go through all these layers again. Here at",
        "corrected_text": " Now we'talk about the integumentary system. Integument refers to skin, and there are two major parts to skin. You have the epidermis, which is composed of a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, and the other part of the skin is not an epithelium, but rather it is dense irregular connective tissue, which is the dermis. As we're going to see, there are different layers to each of these structures. The epidermis in particular is quite a bit different on different regions of skin, depending on whether you're looking at thin skin or thick skin. On this particular section, we have a section of thick skin, which is found on the palms of your hand or the soles of your feet. It has a much thicker epidermal layer than thin skin has, which is how it gets its name. In thick skin, there are five distinct layers of the epidermis that you can visualize. We're going to talk about each of these layers, starting with the basal most layer, which is immediately adjacent to the underlying dermis here. The basal most layer, which tends to be more basophilic than the superficial layers, is called the basal cell layer. You can remember that because it's the basal most layer. These cells are typically cuboidal to columnar in shape. They have dense basophilic staining nuclei. These cells have a high rate of mitotic activity, so they proliferate at high rates to regenerate the upper epithelial layers, which are constantly sloughing off. Here we have basal cell layer, can be several layers thick. Similar to the basal cell layer, you have the next layer, which is called the stratum spinosum. The stratum spinosum gets its name because in some sections that are treated with standard histological stains, such as H and E, you can see intermediate fibers, the tonofilaments that attach to the desmosomes. Much of the cells tend to shrink back, but it causes these intermediate filaments of the desmosomes to really stick out, and it gives them a kind of spiny appearance. That's why it gets its name, stratum spinosum. You may or may not be able to see the spines on your slide. In order to see them, you'll need to look at high magnification. The stratum spinosum is a relatively thick layer, thicker than the basal cell layer typically. Superficial to the stratum spinosum, you have this densely staining basophilic layer, which is called the stratum granulosum, so called because of the presence of numerous granules in the cytoplasm of these cells. This is only a couple cell layers thick, and this really marks the last layer of living cells in stratified keratinized epithelium. All the cells above this layer are essentially dead. Partly that's due to the fact that these cells are producing glycoproteins that help to form a protective hydrophobic barrier above them, and so that also prevents nutrients from being able to diffuse and sustain these cells, which is partly why they die. Superficial to the stratum granulosum, you have this translucent appearing fairly clear layer, which is called the stratum lucidum. That refers to it being lucid or clear, which is what that means, so if you're thinking clearly, you're thinking clearly, so that should help you remember the name of this layer. Stratum lucidum is only visible in thick skin, so if you see this very distinctive layer, that tells you you're looking at thick skin. And finally, superficial to the stratum lucidum, you have the thick stratum corneum layer, which like the cells in the stratum lucidum are dead, but it does not have that translucent appearance.

It goes to the base, but based on what we have here, we think it's probably a little round bump in the skin. And higher magnification, so all these cells have kind of a epithelioid morphology. They're arranged in these little aggregations. We've got a higher magnification. They look like they're little small nests. And they're also these collagen aggregations. It's got almost kind of a trabecular pattern, these struts of collagen between the aggregations that are growing in these nests and cords and strands that coalesce here. So it's not that they've got these little round nests that we classically see with a nevus, but it could be a nevus. But it's an epithelioid process. So there's a differential diagnosis here.

These have receptors for follicle stimulating hormone. This produces an androgen. And then these produce an estrogen through the process of aromatization of that androgen produced by the theca interna cells. Is the pink center the nucleus or the cytoplasm? So this is all the cytoplasm. So in this planar section, the nucleus hasn't been sectioned or isn't present in this section. So if there was a nucleus, it would be fitting around this area here. So this whole thing is cytoplasm. So that continues to develop. In the",

And then this hilum area, after the lymph has percolated through the subcapsular sinus system, the trabecular sinus system, and then in this medullary sinus system, will eventually collect and leave the lymph node via one or two efferent lymphatic vessels, one of which is shown here at the arrow. And then this will repeat itself again and again. So once again, we have a, or in this particular case, with this structure,",

The olfactory epithelium consists of three primary cell types. These smaller basal cells, which are sort of germ cells or replacement cells for the other two cell types, making up the remainder of this olfactory epithelium. The other two cell types are a sustentacular, or supporting cell, and then a typical olfactory bipolar neuron, an actual neuron whose apices will reach the surface, whose cell body lies within the epithelium, though it isn't demarcated or completely visible. So you have a dendrite that actually extends to the surface, its cell body with the nucleus, and then an axon that will then exit into the lamina propria and join to form the phyloolefactoria. The sustentacular and the bipolar neurons cannot be visualized independently in this particular section with a routine staining, but can be if more heroic methods were used. These are the basal cells which form, as I mentioned before, replacement cells for the other two cell types. The lifespan of the bipolar neuron in the olfactory epithelium is between 30 and 60 days. So there is a considerable amount of turnover and replacement of these particular bipolar neurons. One of the reasons for the increase in depth of this particular epithelium is to the progressive differentiation of these bipolar neurons. One might imagine a little bit that these are the dendritic terminals here, but there's no way that we can prove it. If an oblique section is obtained and one can actually trace the processes of these cells to the surface and an olfactory knob is observed, then one can be fairly comfortable dealing with the bipolar neuron short of specific staining. So this is the olfactory epithelium and it has this typical characteristic appearance as you see in the field. Nowhere else in the body do we have an epithelium that looks like this, this very thick pseudostratified columnar. And it is ciliated as well. The olfactory cilia, but they lay sort of parallel or horizontal to the cell surface and aren't readily visible. If one now courses into the thick underlying lamina propria, several structures will come into the field. These are just little clips through the olfactory glands, the olfactory glands of Bowman, that are going to produce this thin watery solvent type of secretion that will lubricate the surface of the olfactory epithelium.

And again, I do, I get these, but not from your own pathologist, but, you know, sent in cases like the one we already saw, where it's just the edema related to neural degeneration. And luckily, of course, the edema waxes and wanes with the eosinophilia, and so you don't have that problem. status spongiosus is a different beast entirely, right? Where you don't have any, where basically there's no neurons left or virtually no neurons left. And so you just have this glial scar. Now, that can happen in long duration pre-eclampsia. So it doesn't exclude it, but it's not spongiform degeneration. And then finally, you know, what we just looked at are fine spongiform degeneration. And the way it works is, and you probably know this already, but basically",

The key to it is getting a good biopsy so when you're taking a biopsy of Paniculitis you need to if you're going to use a scalpel it needs to be at 90 degrees to the skin it can't be a shave type of biopsy if you even think about doing that you're not going to get enough sample. That's number one and number two even a punch biopsy like this one that you see here it's sitting on its side. I'll move it over in a minute has to be deep. You can't just take your punch and put it down to the where the metal meets the plastic. Sometimes you have to actually take the plastic and push it all the way down into the skin. I mean you really have to go deep and it's sometimes tough to get a punch biopsy that goes deep enough. You know this look how deep this is. I mean this is you know most punches usually kind of go about this deep so whoever did this must have been working out. I mean they really pushed very hard and they got way down into the deep part of the fat and that's what you really need for a biopsy of a punch biopsy of Paniculitis. In some cases you probably just need to bite the bullet and do an incisional biopsy of Paniculitis because if there's several things that can go wrong even if you do a punch it's deep enough. If the fat is degenerated you may pull out your punch and you think you've got a nice specimen but most of the fat is sitting out on the bottom of the punch because it's all degenerated and this just turns into goo. There's nothing there so you think you've got a good specimen and maybe you only have a little bit of fat that makes it into the biopsy bottle. Another thing that you need to do in some of these Paniculitis is that you need to see if there's Vascularis and so if you take a punch it's sort of like shooting an arrow and you don't know where it's going to land. I mean you may you may hit a blood vessel you may not and so if you need to have a diagnosis of Paniculitis with Vasculitis if you don't have blood vessel your punch may miss it so if you take a larger incisional biopsy the chances you're going to actually get a blood vessel is higher and if you don't feel comfortable doing that especially if it's somebody that you know maybe he's got a complicated case you know maybe they might have Nodular Vasculitis or maybe they may have PAN or something like that and you really need to get a blood vessel and you don't feel comfortable doing it or maybe your clinics too busy and you don't really time to set it up or whatever then send it to a surgeon and then say hey I need a deep incisional biopsy of this to make a diagnosis. So just realize that half the battle in Paniculitis is getting the biopsy proper getting a good enough sample. So today we're going to go through I got 11 different examples of things the I'm looking at these for the first time just like you are by the way I didn't pre screen these so this is just like we're sitting at the microscope something pops across the stage but instead of its melanoma one specimen the next specimen is a Paniculitis we're looking at all of them with Paniculitis but I'm going to treat it just the same way you are and in order to go through these which I'm going to do just like you are is you have to have a algorithmic approach just like everything else we've talked about so we've talked about the nine different patterns of inflammatory skin disease well now we're talking about the ninth pattern which is Paniculitis and what do you if you use the criteria and if the specimen actually is is demonstrating the features it's really not that hard to make a pretty definitive diagnosis of Paniculitis obviously you always like to have clinical correlation but if you if you use the criteria and if the specimen is good and the specimen is taken in it at a stage in which the Paniculitis is demonstrating its classic features you can make a diagnosis most the time it's easier than superficial perivascular dermatitis for example which give lots of things that cause it or you know 10 different things called spongiotic dermatitis you really have to have clinical correlation there so the main things we look for is first of all whether it's septal mostly lobular mostly and I say mostly because there's usually a mixture of those two it's not usually perfectly 100% septal it's not usually 100% lobular there's usually a mix but if you say it's mostly one or the other that's very helpful and then we ask ourselves whether there's vasculitis or not so that's the second thing we look for and then we look for the type of inflammation that's present if you get all those things together and you start to apply those criteria and again notice there's really not that many branches to the tree it's only a few you can usually make a definitive diagnosis and one other thing we look for is whether there's overlying dermal inflammation so let's take a look at this one so this is the most common form of pinnaculitis that we get biopsied I would say when it's really a true primary inflammatory",

So if we are finding intestinal metaplasia, we know that we are dealing with the gastric atrophy. Now as I said if there is any atrophy then there is going to be a compensatory increase in entracromophen-like cell and this is called ECL cell hyperplasia. Now because there is more production of gastrin from the entrum, so it is going to come and act on the ECL cells and subsequently there is going to be hyperplasia of the ECL cells. If we do a nest straining for synaptic and chromo, we can identify the ECL cell hyperplasia. We call it as ECL cell hyperplasia when we see more than five entracromophen-like cells which are present within the glandular epithelium. So in a normal gland we could just see occasional entracromophen cells, these are the endocrine cells which are being present, they are identified by the presence of this small hyperchromatic oval nuclei and the presence of this perinuclear halo. So if you have more than five these endocrine cells, they are lining in a linear array or as nodular aggregates, that is what is called as entracromophen cell hyperplasia and in this strain, this is the strain with the neuroendocrine markers and we could see that there is increase in the number of these endocrine cells within the gastric epithelium.

So if we are finding intestinal metaplasia, we know that we are dealing with the gastric atrophy. Now as I said if there is any atrophy then there is going to be a compensatory increase in enterochromaffin-like cell and this is called ECL cell hyperplasia. Now because there is more production of gastrin from the entrum, so it is going to come and act on the ECL cells and subsequently there is going to be hyperplasia of the ECL cells. If we do a nest straining for synaptic and chromo, we can identify the ECL cell hyperplasia. We call it as ECL cell hyperplasia when we see more than five enterochromaffin-like cells which are present within the glandular epithelium. So in a normal gland we could just see occasional enterochromaffin cells, these are the endocrine cells which are being present, they are identified by the presence of this small hyperchromatic oval nuclei and the presence of this perinuclear halo.

If it's like distinct like that, yes. Okay, cool, that's helpful, hmm. Well, I feel like we've got a regular neutrophil there.

We'll see how wrong I am in a minute. And those I think are kind of blasty or in the blasty type lineage, but I kind of wonder if they're at different levels of maturation, like, cause they all look kind of different from each other. All right, so now tell me how bad I failed. So that's a basophil. Oh, I thought it was an EO. And that's what the granular basophil looks like. So remember the basophil I showed you before, you know, I looked at it cross-eyed, it would have been degranulated. So that's more of a purple than that pink. Yeah, neutrophil, probably either, I would say sag, cause I can see there's a little there. That's just a funny fold. Myelocyte, myelocyte, myelocyte, either a meta or a myelocyte. It's sort of got that dawning of neutrophilia, so. Oh, I remember hearing that a long time ago. And then that's a blast. A blast, so they are kind of, they're all myeloid precursor cells at different stages. Yeah, so what is this? So then does that mean this person has chronic myeloid leukemia, CML? Yeah, this is CML. Cause you get a range, you don't have enough blasts, right? But, and you have different levels of maturation, okay. Right, and this ended up being chronic phase. So there were less than 5% total blasts in the peripheral blood. So I say that the CML sort of looks like the bone marrow has hit the peripheral blood a little bit. Cause you have all the stages of maturation. You'll often see a myelocyte bulge. Again, I was like myelocyte, myelocyte, myelocyte, myelocyte. Oh, I see. And then you get a basophilia. And you often will also get an absolute eosinophilia. Okay. But CML, again, can be, you know, can present fairly. A lot of different ways, yeah. You can even just get a thrombocytosis. So the real way to diagnose CML is to do the 9-22 translocation test. Okay. So you're BCR able. And these myelocytes, can they look a little bit like monocytes? Or I guess monocytes have the, like a more of a. Yeah, so if you look really, really closely. So these are young monocytes cause they've got that blue tinge still. Wait, they're monocytes or they're myelocytes? Sorry, sorry, myelocytes. Okay. They're young myelocytes cause they have a little bit of that blue tinge yet. They're getting their secondary granules. Oh, okay, I see. So they've transitioned from the pro-myelocyte stage where they only had primary granules and now they're getting their secondary granules. This is a little bit of an older myelocyte. And you can see that cytoplasm looks more like the neutrophil. Okay. They're still myelocytes. Okay, cool. Just, you know, in the book, it looks like things go from here and then jump to here and then jump to here. And it's really like this spectrum. I personally like to give things the benefit of the doubt. And if it's sort of a tweener, I give it the benefit of maturity. Oh, okay. That's helpful. That's good to know. I'm not saying that's right or wrong. It's just what I do consistently. I think- And so you should be just consistent and know what you're gonna do and why. I love that you said that. I think in my areas too, when I teach, I say the same thing. I don't necessarily know if this is the best or right way to handle it. This is just how I do it.

But it is a nodular infiltrate that shows a chronic vasculitis. And there's two conditions where you see this. You see it here in granuloma faciale, but you also see it in erythema elevatum diutinum, which is a histologic identical twin of granuloma faciale. So if you were gonna get this on a board examination, they would not show you erythema elevatum diutinum as a differential diagnosis. That really wouldn't be fair. But they might show you, they might put on the list a pseudolymphoma, lymphocytoma cutis, which hopefully you would not choose in this setting because that does not have neutrophils, does not have any form of chronic vasculitis. That's basically a nodular infiltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils and germinal centers. So that would not be a good choice here. It's not a classic example of just garden variety leukocytoclastic vasculitis either",

Okay Merkel cell carcinomas um good question because they're kind of clear on the face they don't have an epithelioid phenotype when you look at them down the microscope they're small round blue cells they're very very tiny um we should probably quickly look one up shouldn't we to show it the next break. Okay and the other thing is would a Merkel be making all this brown pigment Diane? No it wouldn't here's some brown pigment it was actually relatively hard to find yeah and some bits there are and they're actually in the malignant cells as well as melan",

Some of the cast with the finely granular material are filled or marked clearly with the stains for lysozyme, and here's that same appearance at higher magnification, including some staining in the adjacent tubular epithelium.

These are encased at their periphery, by collections of epithelioid histiocytes. And some of these epithelioid histiocytes have the appearance of foreign body giant cells.

So if you look at metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, it has the same bad prognosis as a small cell. And if you see a stage one, so large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, it has the same prognosis as a stage one small cell. Yeah, it's probably partly too because things get lumped into the large cell neuroendocrine that maybe aren't that, right? Yes, exactly. The problem is that you're also lumping some adenocarcinomas into the large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. So it's a really bad entity because it's lumping three things together, all of which are different. It's lumping, just like Yirene said, it lumps small cell and carcinoids and adenocarcinomas, all three into one group because of various criteria that they've come up with. But I feel it doesn't make sense in a case like this, like she showed, which is classic high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, that to call it large cell neuroendocrine, and I agree that we are forced to call it that and it's fine, but I don't think it makes sense conceptually that this is anything different than a small cell. The problem is we cannot separate, in this group, in this mixed box, we cannot separate by morphology the ones that molecularly look like an adenocarcinoma or that, because if we could, they would have same. It's not that the ones that you are more in doubt are small cell and the ones that look much more like an adenocarcinoma have an ALK. It's a problem to separate. Correct, but molecularly they can be separated, right? So you do have a subset that is positive, not just for Napsin, but also for Keras. So they have both the molecular and the immunosteochemical features of an adenocarcinoma. So they could have separated that and said, look, those are not large cell, those are actually adenocarcinomas with neuroendocrine features. But they said, no, we'll still keep it as large cell neuroendocrine, call it adenocarcinoma. Also by RB loss and TP53 mutation, there is a subset that is identical to small cell carcinoma, molecularly, and they could have said, let's just call it small cell and remove it from this group. But they said, no, this is large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, small cell type. Yeah, everybody should have RB to classify. I think we are not a soft tissue yet. And I think we are allowing everybody to diagnose or say, as everybody doesn't have RB and cannot perform RB, so we still have this entity like this, just in morphology. Do you guys ever use RB for this? And the reason I don't is because RB loss can also be seen in large cellular, which is the same as small cell in my mind. But as long as you have these two categories existing, the RB is not going to help you because it can also be lost in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. I think what people say is it helps. You say it's neuroendocrine versus an adenocarcinoma because it's less commonly lost in high grade adenocarcinomas than it is in neuroendocrine. So if you have something that you're on the fence on is you can use RB as a way to push you. I think this is how some people use it. That's a good argument. Yeah, I see the point there. Do you guys use it? No, we don't use RB. We have a question or anything like you said, Sanjay, we just sign it as high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma when we are not able to decide even after showing to different people and then do molecular testing to see what kind of mutations are there. And then at the back end, try to give them some idea about what kind of therapies or something like that. But otherwise, yeah, we have not gotten into the RB1 kind of situation. The problem with molecular for RB is that you're going to miss a lot of the mutations because a lot of mutations aren't just missense mutations or nonsense. They can be like large deletions, which aren't picked up well by MGS. So in some ways the IHC is actually better because it assesses whether the protein product is being expressed. Is it easy to read Matt? Do you use it? I do, yeah. It's like P53, right? But it's a null pattern that you're looking for, right? And so the normal staining is kind of a patchy staining throughout the tumor. And then the loss is basically no expression. It's pretty clear. Do you also have a strong diffuse that is abnormal like you have for P53 or that in RB you don't have? Not that I've seen. I'd have to check literature to see whether that's in there as well. But most times when I see it's abnormal, it's completely lost. Very interesting. I'm sure it's coming down the pike where we will use it eventually. What kind of controls would you use for RB then? Any normal tissue, any tissue which shows normal expression? Yeah, it's expressed patchy in almost every tissue. And so just I guess if you want non-psycho-controlled, it also shows loss if you use a small cell or something. Yeah, okay. Yeah, this is a great case for all the discussion we had here. This is just a great case to bring that up. So thank you, Irene. So we move to case eight. This is for Sanjay. All right. I have to redeem myself after my melanoma disaster. All right.",

        "corrected_text": " you might have a preponderance of the B cells. These B cells will be of the mantle zone type, being positive for both IgM and IgD. And they're the prominent in the case of lymphocyte-rich subtype. Also in the lymphocyte-rich subtype, in around 50% of the cases, you will have these T cell rosettes composed of follicular T helper cells around the Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells. So this slide, this article shows you the entire immunophenotypic expression of the classical Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells that you see in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. So you have this positivity for both CD30 as well as CD15 in a membrane, as well as a perinuclear Golgi zone pattern, right? And you have a dim expression of PAX5 when you compare it with the background population of the small B cells. There is the in-situ hybridization shows positivity for Epstein-Epstein-Barr virus RNA. In this case, in some cases, there will be a mixture of medium-sized, a bit atypical-looking T cells in the background, like you see over here.

You might have some eosinophils or the eosinophils are not always present, but if they are present, it's good. So basically the reaction pattern that you're seeing here is an exhumative process or a spongiotic dermatitis. And because of the acute reaction, it is an acute spongiotic process. And the prototypical lesion for an acute spongiotic process is allergic contact dermatitis. And allergic contact dermatitis when the patient has been exposed to something, then they're going to develop these spongiotic changes in the epidermis with vesiculation. But you have to always remember, many times in the report, they're just going to get a spongiotic dermatitis as a report basically. And it can be related to a lot of different things. So there's a paper about spongiosis and the way it goes is spongiosis can be caused by 800 things actually. So this pattern can be seen in deshydrotic eczema. This pattern can be seen in nominal eczema. So a clinical pathological correlation is very important when you're talking about any exhumative process actually.

If the clinician says that these are nominal lesions, then most likely that these are coin-shaped lesions, then it is most likely going to be nominal eczema. The irritant contact dermatitis is going to show more. Based on the pathophysiology, the irritant contact is because something is irritating the epidermis. So based on that, what is the changes that you're going to see in the skin are going to be some changes that will tell you that something is irritating the epidermis. On the top, you're going to see some dyskeratotic cells and also some neutrophils. So if you see those, then you think of irritant contact dermatitis actually. So you have to do a clinical pathological correlation to come to a definitive diagnosis in an exhumative process. Otherwise, most of the times the report that you're going to get is spongiotic dermatitis. It could be acute, it could be subacute, or it could be chronic. When it becomes chronic, the patient has been scratching a lot. And so the same, because of the scratching, the epidermis is going to react in a certain way. So it is going to become acanthotic. The dermis is going to show you some fibrosis. So if you start seeing those changes along with mild spongiosis, then you think of a chronic exhumative process actually.

So it does have its advantage. You get a better idea of the elastic tissue that still remains within many of these muscular or distributing arteries. Having completed an examination of a muscular or distributing type of artery, go then to the wall of an organ and look for small arteries of different sizes and calibers to see what these small arteries look like. They are small arteries because one rule of thumb could be because they're not isolated and they're within the wall of an organ. An excellent place to look because of its very vascular nature is in the wall or the adventitia of the gallbladder. The small arteries will show a very prominent media. There's one located here in the center of the field of view. So this is an artery always characterized as is the aorta or the elastic, the muscular arteries, all through the arterial system by the dominance of smooth muscle in the media wall. Indeed, some may be modified somewhat as in the elastic or the conducting type of arteries. But a prominent feature is always the smooth muscle in the media wall that sort of forms a donut, a very prominent ring, all the way through the system, all down to the smallest arterial. And this should make perfect sense. This is how arterial pressure is maintained by the contraction and the pressure exerted on the lumen by this media in the smooth muscle wall. Nonetheless, this is a typical small artery. It perhaps has eight or 10 smooth muscle wraps. Most small arteries, they'll extend maybe from 15 or 20 smooth muscle wraps down to about three. That's the usual classification. With small arterioles or arterioles having two smooth muscle wraps or layouts, one, and then sort of a gap as it opens into an open spiral. So this is a small artery.

So it does have its advantage. You get a better idea of the elastic tissue that still remains within many of these muscular or distributing arteries. Having completed an examination of a muscular or distributing type of artery, go then to the wall of an organ and look for small arteries of different sizes and calibers to see what these small arteries look like. They are small arteries because one rule of thumb could be because they're not isolated and they're within the wall of an organ. An excellent place to look because of its very vascular nature is in the wall or the adventitia of the gallbladder. The small arteries will show a very prominent media.

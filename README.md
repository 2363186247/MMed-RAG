# MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models

We introduce MMed-RAG, a powerful multimodal RAG system that boosts the factuality of Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) by up to 43.8%! ü©∫  &nbsp; &nbsp; [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085)] [[X(Twitter)](https://x.com/HuaxiuYaoML/status/1847097594641584574)]

## üöÄ News
- [10/20/2024] The whole data is released in `data/`! Check it out!
- [10/18/2024] The manuscript can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085).

## üí° Overview
MMed-RAG enhances alignment across medical domains like radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology with a domain-aware retrieval mechanism. And it tackles three key challenges in alignment of multimodal RAG:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Copy Homework from Others‚ùå Think it by Self ‚úÖ
MMed-RAG helps Med-LVLMs avoid blindly copying external information by encouraging the model to rely on its own visual reasoning when solving complex problems.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cannot Solve Problems by Self‚ùå Learn How to Copy ‚úÖ
When Med-LVLMs are unsure, MMed-RAG teaches the model to intelligently use retrieved knowledge, pulling in the right information at the right time, boosting accuracy, and reducing errors.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Copied Homework is Wrong‚ùå Avoid Interference from Incorrect Homework ‚úÖ
MMed-RAG prevents models from being misled by incorrect retrievals, reducing the risk of generating inaccurate medical diagnoses.

## üì¶ Requirements
1. Clone this repository and navigate to MMed-RAG folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.git
cd MMed-RAG
```

2. Install Package: Create conda environment

```Shell
conda create -n MMed-RAG python=3.10 -y
conda activate MMed-RAG
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
pip install trl
```

3. Download the required model checkpoints [LLaVA-Med-1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b) from huggingface.

4. For all the medical datasets, you need firstly apply for the right of access and then download the dataset.

## üìñ Data Description
We provide a corresponding json or jsonl file for each dataset, including the image path, question, answer, and original report.

- Training: The data used to train the retriever and fine-tune the Med-LVLM are located in `data/training/retriever/MODALITY` and `data/training/alignment/MODALITY` respectively. Each folder contains data for VQA or report generation tasks.

- Test: All the test data for Med-LVLMs is placed under `data/test/TASK/MODALITY`. 

`TASK`: report/vqa, `MODALITY`: radiology/pathology/ophthalmology.  


## üèãÔ∏è Train

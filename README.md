# MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models

We introduce MMed-RAG, a powerful multimodal RAG system that boosts the factuality of Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) by up to 43.8%! ü©∫  &nbsp; &nbsp; [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085)] [[X(Twitter)](https://x.com/HuaxiuYaoML/status/1847097594641584574)]

## üí° Overview
MMed-RAG enhances alignment across medical domains like radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology with a domain-aware retrieval mechanism. And it tackles three key challenges in alignment of multimodal RAG:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Copy Homework from Others‚ùå Think it by Self ‚úÖ
MMed-RAG helps Med-LVLMs avoid blindly copying external information by encouraging the model to rely on its own visual reasoning when solving complex problems.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cannot Solve Problems by Self‚ùå Learn How to Copy ‚úÖ
When Med-LVLMs are unsure, MMed-RAG teaches the model to intelligently use retrieved knowledge, pulling in the right information at the right time, boosting accuracy, and reducing errors.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Copied Homework is Wrong‚ùå Avoid Interference from Incorrect Homework ‚úÖ
MMed-RAG prevents models from being misled by incorrect retrievals, reducing the risk of generating inaccurate medical diagnoses.
